;;;Typical case:
;;;
;;;(curRoom setInset: insetInstance whoToCue <register>)
;;;
;;;(instance insetInstance of Inset
;;;	(properties
;;;		view	 			;for bitmap
;;;		loop
;;;		cel
;;;		x					;default will center
;;;		y
;;;	)
;;;)
;;;
;;;Note: we can also use a picture by just setting the picture property.
;;;
;;;
;;;Case where we have Views within inset:
;;;
;;;(curRoom setInset: insetInstance whoToCue register TRUE)
;;;
;;;The register parameter is a scratch property.
;;;The last parameter tells the init of the Inset class not to call the
;;;drawInset: method.  This is so the bitmap doesn't showup first and then
;;;the Views can be seen being drawn afterwards.  So if you have Views other 
;;;than the bitmap in your inset your code will look like:
;;;
;;;Note: if your inset doesn't have a picture, do not pass the fourth
;;;parameter, or you will get a black plane. The fourth parameter is 
;;;only passed if you have a picture and views that you want to appear
;;;simultaneously.

;;;Of course any Views that you want to show up after the inset is up
